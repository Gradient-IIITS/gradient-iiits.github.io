As a result, due to lack of guidance they are let down ,take up inefficient learning methods and end up getting frustrated. This article aims to guide beginners on how to start your journey into the world of competitive programming.</p>
<p>These are the brief areas I wish to cover in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prerequisites to get into competitive programming.</li>
<li>List of basic topics a beginner should be acquainted with.</li>
<li>Views (slightly biased) on various OJ’s.</li>
<li>Advice on practice routines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Strong implementation and programming skills are a must to get into CP. Basic programming experience, especially with C/C++/Java would give you a definite head-start as you start the journey. Basic concepts such as arrays, loops and functions must be ingrained in your mind. If not, taking time to refine these ideas would certainly bear fruit in the long run.</p>
<p>As far as languages are concerned, C++ is language to go for CP. Around three quarters of professional sport programmers use C++. Standard Template Library(STL) is immensely beneficial when it comes to CP and is highly popular among the masses. Java is the second most popular language and is almost equally good. Seldom are any other languages used by professionals.</p>
<p>To sum it up, these skills are what you need to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong programming logic/ thinking in terms of code.</li>
<li>Programming experience in C++ or Java. Further, learning STL would be highly beneficial. The topcoder articles on STL are a good starting point.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="basic-topics">Basic topics:</h3>
<p>The articles listed below are crucial to get started with CP.  Topcoder tutorials are a great resource to get your basics right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Binary Search</li>
</ol>
<p>     Get acquainted with the applications of binary search when it comes   to optimisation problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Graph algorithms</p>
<ol>
<li>Depth First Search</li>
<li>Breadth First Search</li>
<li>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</li>
<li>Kruskal’s Algorithm</li>
<li>Topological sorting</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic Programming</p>
<ol>
<li>Knapsack Problem</li>
<li>Longest Common Subsequence</li>
<li>Longest Increasing Subsequence</li>
<li>Subset Sum problem</li>
<li>Rod cutting problem</li>
<li>Matrix chain multiplication</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greedy Algorithms</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that greedy algorithms are pretty easy to come up with, but difficult to prove, even the experts find it hard to prove some of them.</p>
<p>Fractional Knapsack and the job sequencing are some of the most common problems you might come across in the beginning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Number theory
<ol>
<li>Modular arithmetic</li>
<li>Binary Exponentiation</li>
<li>Sieve of Eratosthenes</li>
<li>Euclidean GCD</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>  </p>
<h3 id="views-on-various-ojs">Views on various OJ’s</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Codechef: They conduct three rated contests every month - two short contests and one long challenge. It is highly popular among Indian college students. Level of problems are pretty diverse. The only disadvantage is the quality of the discussion forums. Editorial quality is excellent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codeforces: The most popular choice among competitive programmers as of now. They conduct around 7-8 rated short contests every month. Quality of problems is pretty good and discussion forums are quite active. Their editorials might not be as clear as the ones in codechef.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SPOJ: This one doesn’t host contests as the previous two, it is exclusively meant for practice. SPOJ consists of all the classical problems one would come across, hence it is a good starting point for beginners. Unofficial editorials for most of the problems can be googled up easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topcoder: They were among the first to host programming contests online. Topcoder problems are very high in quality and editorials are highly comprehensive. Their forums are not very active and beginners might get a bit intimidated by the interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advice-on-practice-routine">Advice on practice routine:</h3>
<p>Many beginners refrain from participating in contests in the beginners citing the fact that they have no knowledge of algorithms. Contrary to popular beliefs, many problems use only basic logical thinking and implementation skills. Hence participation in contest is very necessary to know what your shortcomings are. At the same time, upsolving i.e. learning how to solve problems which you weren’t able to solve in the contest is very important, this very single step would help you make strides in the CP world.</p>
<p>In the beginning, make sure you don’t spend time learning advanced algorithms, as you are bound to forget them if you don’t use them in problems. Make sure you get your basics right and only learn advanced concepts once you are able to solve easy problems without any hassle. Always remember, Competitive Programming is a mind sport - just like chess, it requires a lot of practice to make a mark, the top sport programmers have been doing it for 9-10 years. So, don’t lose heart if you fail in the contests in the beginning.</p>
